## 🌌 Overview

Welcome to **LUNA-MYCO-GENESIS**, the world's first open-source initiative dedicated to the agricultural impossibility of farming **Unicorns (Equus monoceros)** on the surface of the **Moon**, specifically using giant, genetically modified space mushrooms as the primary growth vector.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** This project requires a Class 5 Reality Distortion Field. Do not attempt to run this on a standard Newtonian physics engine.

---

## 📊 The Growth Cycle

We use a complex state machine to track the biological evolution from spore to sparkle.

Ah, the classic Mermaid syntax tantrum! This usually happens because GitHub's parser gets confused if there isn't enough "breathing room" (blank lines) between the diagram code and the rest of the text. It tried to eat your horizontal rule (`---`) and the next header, thinking they were part of the map.

Per your instructions, here is the corrected, full code in English with extra spacing to ensure GitHub renders everything perfectly.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you launch your shuttle, ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your reality matrix:

| Dependency | Version | Required Amount | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stardust** | `v4.2.0` | 500kg | Must be gathered from the trailing edge of a comet. |
| **Hope** | `latest` | ∞ | Do not use the deprecated 'Despair' library. |
| **Cheese** | `Gouda` | 1 Wheel | The moon is made of it; bring extra for patching holes. |
| **Flux Capacitor** | `1.21GW` | 1 | For time-traveling back to fix your mistakes. |

## 💾 Installation

To deploy the fungal colony, copy the following incantation into your terminal. **Do not read it aloud**, or you may summon a developer advocate.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/nasa/top-secret/unicorn-farm.git](https://github.com/nasa/top-secret/unicorn-farm.git)

# Install dependencies
npm install star-dust --save-dev
npm install magic-wand -g

# Initialize the lunar surface
sudo terraform apply -var="gravity=0.16" -var="atmosphere=false"

# Plant the seeds
run-sequence inject-mycelium --target="Sea of Tranquility"

```

## 🧬 Configuration Variables

Adjust your `cosmos.env` file to optimize horn length and mane fluffiness.

```json
{
  "atmosphere_composition": {
    "oxygen": "1%",
    "glitter": "99%"
  },
  "unicorn_settings": {
    "color_palette": ["#FF00FF", "#00FFFF", "#FFFF00"],
    "temperament": "Sassy",
    "can_fly": true,
    "diet": ["Dreams", "Cotton Candy", "C++ Pointers"]
  },
  "mushroom_host": {
    "species": "Amanita Muscaria Galactica",
    "size": "Gigantic"
  }
}

```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

<details>
<summary><strong>CLICK TO EXPAND: Protocol 88 - The Rainbow Injection</strong></summary>

### The Rainbow Injection

If your mushrooms are refusing to sprout horns, you must initiate the **Prism Overdrive**.

1. Align your satellite dish to the constellation **Monoceros**.
2. Play *Dark Side of the Moon* in reverse.
3. Execute the following function:

```javascript
function injectRainbows(mushroom) {
    const intensity = Math.random() * 1000;
    if (intensity > 900) {
        return new Unicorn({ type: 'Legendary', sparkle: true });
    } else {
        console.log("Just a regular horse with a cone glued on.");
        return null;
    }
}

```

### 👾 Space Pests

Watch out for **Moon Crabs**. They love eating unicorn hooves.

* **Defense:** loud techno music.
* **Weapons:** Laser pointers (unicorns love them, crabs hate them).

</details>

---

## 📉 Known Issues

* **Bug #102:** Sometimes the unicorns grow two heads. This is a feature, not a bug. Double the magic.
* **Bug #345:** Gravity failure causes unicorns to float away into deep space. *Workaround: Tie them down with heavy thoughts.*
* **Error 500:** Internal Server Error. The Moon has crashed. Please reboot the solar system.

### What changed?

I added **explicit empty lines** around the ` ```mermaid ` block. GitHub's renderer sometimes fails to find the end of the code if the closing backticks are followed immediately by another Markdown element like `---`.

**Would you like me to generate a "Space Potato" image that you can host in your repository to make it even more ridiculous?**

```
